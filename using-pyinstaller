To make pyinstaller work correctly, use the -F and --windowed flags:

pyinstaller animal.gui.py -F --windowed

-F condenses everything into one executable file --windowed hides the
terminal output window.

The output will be in a folder called dist. You need to copy the .glade
file into the dist folder. Also copy any other resources that the program
uses, like pictures.

To complete the installation, we will need to make a windows script hat
makes a link to the executable so that the users do not need to poke
around in the dest folder.
