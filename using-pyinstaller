To make pyinstaller work correctly, use the --windowed flag:

pyinstaller animal-gui.py FileChooser.py FileSelectWindow.py Handlers.py  --windowed

Each script needs to be named so that it can create the import files from each of them.

--windowed 
	hides the terminal output window.

-F
	Converts everything into one exe file, but makes the program take a
	long time to load because it has to extract all the files to a
	temporary folder. This takes especially long on windows.

The output will be a folder named animal-gui in a folder called dist.
You need to copy the .glade file into the dist/animal-gui/ folder. Also
copy any other resources that the program uses, like pictures.

To complete the installation, we will need to make a windows script that
makes a link to the executable so that the users do not need to poke
around in the installation folder.
