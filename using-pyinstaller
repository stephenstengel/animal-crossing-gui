Command that works (Linux):
pyinstaller sorter-gui.py --windowed --add-data="settings.ini:." --add-data="checkpoint:checkpoint"

(Windows): Windows uses semicolons; for path separators instead of colons:
pyinstaller sorter-gui.py --windowed --add-data="settings.ini;." --add-data="checkpoint;checkpoint"

--windowed 
	hides the terminal output window. Output will still show if you run
	the exe from the command line.

-F
	Converts everything into one exe file, but makes the program take a
	long time to load because it has to extract all the files to a
	temporary folder. This takes especially long on windows.

--add-data=
	Include a file or folder in the output files. The syntax is:
	
		"sourceName:destinationFolder"
	
	So "checkpoint:." would take the files inside the checkpoint folder
	and scatter them all into the base directory of the output.

The output will be a folder named sorter-gui in a folder called dist.

To complete the installation, we will need to make a windows script that
makes a link to the executable so that the users do not need to poke
around in the installation folder.
