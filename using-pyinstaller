Command that works (Linux):
pyinstaller sorter-gui.py --windowed --add-data="settings.ini:." --add-data="checkpoint:checkpoint"
(Windows): Windows uses semicolons; for path separators instead of colons:
pyinstaller sorter-gui.py --windowed --add-data="settings.ini;." --add-data="checkpoint;checkpoint"

To make pyinstaller work correctly, use the --windowed flag on the script
that you want compiled:

pyinstaller sorter-gui.py --windowed
pyinstaller animal-gui.py --windowed
pyinstaller cmdsorting.py

--windowed 
	hides the terminal output window. Output will still show if you run
	the exe from the command line.

-F
	Converts everything into one exe file, but makes the program take a
	long time to load because it has to extract all the files to a
	temporary folder. This takes especially long on windows.

The output will be a folder named sorter-gui in a folder called dist.
For the gtk version, you need to copy the .glade file into the
dist/animal-gui/ folder. Also copy any other resources that the program
uses, like pictures. All versions need a checkpoint folder in the
executable's directory that contains a saved tensorflow model.

To complete the installation, we will need to make a windows script that
makes a link to the executable so that the users do not need to poke
around in the installation folder.
