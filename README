Animal Crossing GUI

This is the gui repository for the Animal Crossing project. This program
will take pictures in a folder and decide what kind of animal the
picture is of. It will then copy the original images into sorted
folders.

cmdsorting.py is a standalone terminal / command prompt only version of
the program.

On mac and linux, you can compile the pyinstaller exe version of the
program by typing "make" in a terminal. You can compile the command line
only version by typing "make cmd".

TODO:

Make a script that creates a Windows shortcut to the exe file and place
it on the user's desktop or start menu.
