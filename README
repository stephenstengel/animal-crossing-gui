Animal Crossing GUI

This is the gui repository for the Animal Crossing project. This program
will take pictures in a folder and decide what kind of animal the
picture is of. It will then copy the original images into sorted
folders.

cmdsorting.py is a standalone terminal / command prompt only version of
the program.
