Instructions to create the exes for this version:

The installation command should be:

	pyinstaller main-script-name.py --windowed

Leave off --windowed for testing.

Step 1:
	Use pyinstaller from within your tensorflow environment to make the exe for the cmdsorting script. It is stand alone and will work on the command line.

Step 2:
	Use pyinstaller from within the msys2 mingw64 gtk building environment to create an exe for the gui.

Step 3:
	Place the dist folder created in step 1 for the cmdsorting exe and place it into the dist folder created for the gui. So it should look like:

	dist/animal-gui/animal-gui-folder/dist/cmdsorting/cmdsorting-files

Step 4:
	Copy a checkpoint folder into the dist/animal-gui/ folder. Also, make a directory filled with images to sort, and another directory that will recieve the sorted images. Hard coded to 100x100 images right now.

Another option is to use the -F flag with pyinstaller to make the exes contain all the neccessary files, but that increases load time on windows by a lot.
