Animal Crossing Project Animal Sorter
Command Line Version

This is the command line only version of the Animal Sorter!
It takes a folder of pictures and sorts them into folders based on what
the machine learing model thinks they are.
The original images are not deleted.

Usage:
	./cmdsorting.exe inputs-folder outputs-folder

Example:
	./cmdsorting.exe a-few-pics test-outputs

You may need to specify the full path to these folders if they are not
in the same folder as cmdsorting.exe
